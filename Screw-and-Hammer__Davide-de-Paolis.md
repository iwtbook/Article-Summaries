Summary:
- We love to think of solutions before we've even fully thought about the problem at hand
- We're biased, we've tried solutions that have worked in the past, and now we want to use that
  solution everywhere because we know it works
  - I've successfully hammered some nails before, my hammer definitely works. Even though this new problem
    is screws, I want to try to hammer them because I know my hammer works.
- Our goal as developers is to find the _best_ solution to the problem, not _a_ solution
  - We do this with algorithms, so why not with the whole project?
  - We optimize algorithms to find the most efficient solution, we should optimize projects to find the
    most efficient way to complete the project, one that balances the least amount of code (total, not just lines you write) and the best quality result for the end user
